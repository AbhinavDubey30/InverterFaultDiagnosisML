**Deep Learning-Enhanced Inverter Fault Detection System**

**üìù Description**

A sophisticated fault detection system that combines deep learning and ensemble methods to identify anomalies in inverter operations. The system employs neural networks for feature extraction and Random Forest classification for reliable fault detection, achieving robust performance through a hybrid architecture.

**üåü Features**

Deep Feature Extraction: Utilizes a multi-layer neural network for advanced feature learning
Ensemble Learning: Implements Random Forest classification for robust decision making
Dimensionality Reduction: PCA implementation for optimal feature compression
Comprehensive Preprocessing: Automated data cleaning and normalization pipeline
Performance Metrics: Detailed evaluation metrics and classification reports
